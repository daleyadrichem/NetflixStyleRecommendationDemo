    "In this notebook we have a toy pipeline that mirrors the **big ideas** behind a system like Netflix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data layer**\n",
    "   - We built a ratings matrix (`user_item_matrix`).\n",
    "   - We defined movie metadata (genres).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Candidate generation**\n",
    "   - Collaborative filtering via matrix factorization (user and movie latent factors).\n",
    "   - Content-based similarity using genres and cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ranking**\n",
    "   - We combined multiple signals (CF prediction + content similarity) into a single score.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Personalization**\n",
    "   - Recommendations are different for each user based on their rating history.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real production systems:\n",
    "- The dataset is **massive** (millions of users, thousands of movies or more).\n",
    "- Models are **bigger** (deep neural networks, sequence models, etc.).\n",
    "- There are many other signals: time of day, device, thumbnail artwork, etc.\n",
    "- Training and serving happen on **distributed infrastructure**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But conceptually, what you saw here is the core idea:\n",
    "> **Represent users and items as vectors, then use similarity and learned scores to rank items for each user.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now integrate this notebook into your AI workshop to:\n",
    "- Show participants how recommendation works step by step.\n",
    "- Connect the math (vectors, dot products, optimization) to real-world AI use cases.\n"
